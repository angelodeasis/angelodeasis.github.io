# NotetakingEnhancementProject
Using optical recognition models, NLP, and machine learning concepts to improve note-taking.

Hand-writing notes has demonstrable benefits for students, but many still choose to take notes dig-
itally for convenience in storage, backup, and searching.

This project is primarly meant to:
- Obtain an image/set of notes
- Reorganize or reformat notes
- Help user study


This is only the first version of the program, made as a Flashcard conversion PDF website.


To run:
